aboveground biomass,all biomass of living vegetation,min dbh ,acceptable to exclude understory if minor component
,,biomass allometry,
,,include dead standing?,no
belowground biomass,all biomass of live roots ,min dbh (coarse roots),
,,allometry or assumed ratio of belowground to aboveground biomass (IPCC table 4.4) ,
,,min root diameter,fine roots may be excluded when they cannot be distinguished empirically from soil organic matter or litter
,,sampling depth,
dead wood ,"all non-living woody biomass not contained in the litter, either standing, lying on the ground, or in the soil ",min diameter,"10 cm default, but may be chosen by country"
,,include belowground?,yes
litter ,"all non-living biomass with a size greater than the limit for soil organic matter  and less than the minimum diameter chosen for dead wood, lying dead, in various states of decomposition above or within the mineral or organic soil ",max diameter (= max diameter for deadwood),"10 cm default, but may be chosen by country"
,,layers included,includes entire O horizon
,,include belowground? ,yes
soil organic matter ,organic carbon in mineral soils to a specified depth ,sampling depth ,"depth = 30 cm default, but may be chosen by country"
