aboveground biomass,all biomass of living vegetation,min dbh ,may exclude understory if minor component
,,include non-dicot trees? ,?
,,include dead standing?,no
,,biomass allometry,?
belowground biomass,all biomass of live roots ,all factors relevant to aboveground biomass,see above
,,allometry or assumed ratio of below- to above-ground biomass (R),can estimate based on R
,,min root diameter,may exclude fine roots
,,sampling depth,?
dead wood ,"all non-living woody biomass above a specified diameter, aboveground or belowground",min diameter,"10 cm default, but may be chosen by country"
,,include belowground?,yes
litter ,"all non-living biomass smaller than dead wood but larger than soil organic matter, in various states of decomposition both above or within the mineral or organic soil",max diameter (= min diameter for deadwood),"10 cm default, but may be chosen by country"
,,min size (= size limit for soil organic matter),?
,,layers included,"entire O horizon: litter (OL),  fumic (OF),  and  humic (OH) layers"
