\introduction[Introduction]

**As we seek to mitigate climate change [@unfccc_adoption_2015], forests are critical.**
*(See intros to other papers for relevant refs)*
Under Paris Agreement, **##**% of Nationally Determined Contributions relate to forests [@grassi_key_2017].

**The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides guidance for national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories for reporting to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change [UNFCCC, (REFS for older guidelines), @ipcc_2019_2019].**
Under this guidance, GHG inventories include all managed land, including most of the world's forest land [@ogle_delineating_2018].
The IPCC inventory guidelines include specific instructions for accounting for forest land ... [@ipcc_agriculture_2006; @ipcc_2019_2019a].
This guidance has improved as more of the relevant underlying data has become available [@requenasuarez_estimating_2019], but there remains room for continuous improvement as the science advances.
For example, @cook-patton_mapping_2020 *(summarize IPCC comparison results)*. 
*Moreover, it is useful for those compiling national greenhouse gas inventories to have access to locally-specific information, when available.*
To improve the data accessible for C accounting, the IPCC created the Emission Factor Database (EFDB; https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/EFDB/main.php), which is intended as a recognized library of emission factors and other parameters that can be used for estimating greenhouse gas emissions and removals.

**The Global Forest Carbon Database, ForC, is the largest collection of published estimates of forest carbon stocks, increments, and annual fluxes [@anderson-teixeira_forc_2018; @anderson-teixeira_carbon_2021].**
*(add stats/ details)*
As such, ForC is positioned to improve forest C accounting through the transfer of data to EFDB.
The purpose of this publication is to document that process and provide recommendations for future improvements.

**Here, we**
(1) review IPCC definitions of relevant carbon stocks and increments
(2) describe mapping of ForC to IPCC's EFDB,
(3) describe updates to ForC  (ForC v4.0),
(4) summarize the data in ForC that's relevant to EFDB, identifying gaps, and
(5) provide recommendations for improving data collection, analysis, database, and accounting.


# IPCC definitions of carbon stocks and incremenets

For quantifying forest role in global C cycle, we ultimately care about:
(1) C stocks -- stores of C that would be vulnerable to release to the atmosphere upon land use change
(2) C increments -- changes in those C stocks.


## Carbon stocks

Forest ecosystem C stocks may be parsed into pools in various ways. 
IPCC parses into biomass (aboveground and belowground), dead organic matter (dead wood and litter), and soil organic matter (Table&nbsp;\@ref(table_variables)).
Quantifying these requires a one-time measurement.


```{r table_variables, eval = TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
C_pools_table <- read.csv("figures_tables/C_pools.csv")
names(C_pools_table) <- stringr::str_replace_all(names(C_pools_table), "\\.", " ")

library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
knitr::kable(C_pools_table, format = "latex",
             longtable = FALSE,
             caption = "\\textbf{Variables with definitions and measurement methods.} Definitions from IPCC Table 1.1. (See Table 1.1 in IPCC guidance).") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = TRUE) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE)
```

### Biomass
Biomass includes living vegetation, above- and below-ground.

The IPCC defines aboveground biomass as "all biomass of living vegetation, both woody and herbaceous, above the soil including stems, stumps, branches, bark, seeds, and foliage" [].

Belowground biomass is defined as "all biomass of live roots" [].

### Dead Organic Matter

Dead organic matter includes all non-living biomass that is not within the mineral soil layer and smaller than the litter size threshold.

Dead wood is defined as...

Litter is defined as including " all  non-living  biomass  with  a  diameter  less  than  a  minimum  diameter  chosen  by  the  country  (for  example 10 cm), lying dead, in various states of decomposition above the mineral or organic soil. This includes litter,  fumic,  and  humic  layers.  Live  fine  roots  (of  less  than  the  suggested  diameter  limit for  belowground  biomass) are included in litter where they cannot be distinguished from it empirically." (2003 IPCc GPG for LULUCF (https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/gpglulucf/gpglulucf_files/Glossary_Acronyms_BasicInfo/Glossary.pdf)

### Soil Organic Matter

Soil organic matter is defined as...

## Carbon increments

C increments are defined as the change over time, in annual increments, in each C pool.
These may be estimated as the difference between C stocks at two time points, or as the difference between inputs and outputs to the pool (i.e., fluxes).
Quantifying these requires at least two measurements.

Fluxes are the inputs and outputs to each pool.

Additional caveats are as follows: 1- assumes minimal non-respiratory C fluxes,... (Chapin et al. 2006); 2- assumes that change in foliage biomass is negligible (see note 7); 3- incomplete: excludes large branch fall; also, under IPCC definitions, outflux from aboveground biomass should include all sizes, influx to deadwood should include only above the minimum diameter chosen for dead wood; 4- incomplete: excludes belowground components;  5-incomplete: excludes breakage into pieces less than dead wood threshold size; 6-incomplete: excludes woody mortality of stems <10 cm DBH, decomposition of dead wood (aboveground and coarse roots) into sizes classified as litter; 7-foliage production is generally measured by collecting leaf-fall, a method that assumes that the influx = outflux (foliage biomass is roughly constant year-to-year)."}

# Mapping ForC to EFDB

## Carbon cycle variables

Mapping is shown in Fig. 1

Define relationship among NEE, NEP, and delta.C., especially noting role of harvest [@chapin_reconciling_2006].

## Land use categories

Documented at https://github.com/forc-db/IPCC-EFDB-integration/blob/main/doc/ForC-EFDB_mapping/defining_land_subcategory.md, https://github.com/forc-db/IPCC-EFDB-integration/blob/main/doc/ForC-EFDB_mapping/IPCC_LandUse_mapping.csv, and in [issue #8](https://github.com/forc-db/IPCC_database_integration/issues/8). 


The UNFCCC requires GHG reporting for all managed lands in a country, where management is defined as "human interventions and practices have been applied to perform production, ecological or social functions" [*IPCC 2006 full report REF*]. 
This definition is applied differently across countries, and is not clearly defined by the majority of governments [@ogle_delineating_2018]. 
Given this, and because the IPCC definition of management does not necessarily match that which would be reported in scientific publications and hence in ForC, we do not transfer any classification of land management status from ForC to the EFDB, but do provide auxiliary info that may be useful in making this determination (e.g., geographical location).

# Updates to ForC  (ForC v4.0)

To support export of data to EFDB, and to improve the overall quality of the ForC database, we defined ## new variables, implemented some modest restructuring, resolved duplicate records, and conducted quality control.
This section describes changes relative to ForC v2.0 [@anderson-teixeira_forc_2018].

## Defining new variables



We added eleven increment variables to the set of named and defined variables (or 22, counting _OM and _C versions), which previously included only one (aboveground biomass increment, *delta.agb*). 
*(https://github.com/forc-db/IPCC-EFDB-integration/issues/6)*
These are directly related to C stocks as previously defined in ForC, with "*delta.*" added in front of the variable name.

Although these variables currently lack records, the structure exists such that records can be populated over time. 

We clarified the definition of *organic.layer* (O-horizon, including *litter*) and added the variable *litter* (relatively undecomposed plant material/ OL horizon).

## ForC restructuring

```{r table_ForCchanges, eval = TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#"figures_tables/record_of_changes.csv" is copied over from the table located at  https://github.com/forc-db/ForC/blob/master/database_management_records/record_of_changes.csv, and I deleted the date field.

record_of_changes <- read.csv("figures_tables/record_of_changes.csv")
names(record_of_changes) <- stringr::str_replace_all(names(record_of_changes), "\\.", " ")

library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
knitr::kable(record_of_changes, format = "latex",
             longtable = FALSE,
             caption = "\\textbf{Table of changes to ForC fields.}") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = TRUE) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE)
```


## Quality control measures
Prior to releasing ForC v4.0, we executed several quality control measures.
First, to improve information on geographic coordinates, we flagged and reviewed records with suspected low precision *(Issue #29)[https://github.com/forc-db/ForC/issues/229]*.
Second, to identify erroneous climate data... *(Issue #212)[https://github.com/forc-db/ForC/issues/212]*.

## Resolving duplicates


# Results

**figure: map of relevant ForC data with underlying FAO ecozones**

**(summarize the data in ForC that's relevant to EFDB, identifying gaps)**

dead wood and litter comparisons will be particularly interesting, as IPCC values are based on just a handful of references for each climate zone (table 2.2 in 2019 guidelines)

# Recommendations

## Data collection and analysis needs

**(Paragraph highlighting important gaps in variables / regions)**


Several variables of value to IPCC, including standing dead wood, woody mortality, delta.agb, are not calculated and presented as frequently as are AGB and ANPP_woody, even though they can readily be derived from the same census data. 
We recommend that researchers calculate and report these, as specified below.
Furthermore, there is an opportunity to fill data gaps by calculating these from existing census data.
For example, the core census protocol of the Forest Global Earth Observatory [ForestGEO; REFS] collects the data required to calculate standing dead wood, woody mortality, and delta.agb, but these have not been calculated and reported for all sites for which the appropriate number of censuses are available (n=1 for standing dead wood, n=2 for woody mortality and delta.agb) [but see REFS].


A universal challenge in estimating biomass (living or dead) from forest census data is applying appropriate allometries to convert DBH measurements to biomass.
*(Camille/Helene can write this paragraph easily.)*

## Data reporting needs

We recommend that, unless they have some specific reason to do otherwise, researchers calculate and report the values according to IPCC standards:

  - adopt common standards for variables like min diameter of deadwood, select soil sampling increments to include a cutoff at 30.
  
  - report 95% CIs, SE, or STD and n
  
  - report C variables in article text, table, or SI table. EFDB cannot accept data digitized from figures

For data synthesis projects, compilation can only be useful to the EFDB if they include all the required, along with transparent description on the methodology applied to derive emission factors (or have a brief description and a reference to the original source) and the original emission factor values are present (not modified/rounded).  

**Contributing data to ForC and/or EFDB directly will ensure its broader impact.**
The latter is more efficient for getting data to EFDB, but does not get the data into ForC, where it can be more broadly useful--for example, being used for basic science [e.g., @banburymorgan_global_2021; @anderson-teixeira_carbon_2021] or model benchmarking [@fer_ecosystem_2021].

## Database needs

There are plenty of relevant, published data that are not included in ForC. 
Systematic review of the literature could vastly improve data coverage.
*(There are some efforts underway, including a few that Susan can specify.)*

## IPCC 

An important challenge is that forests are changing rapidly, and data collected a decaade ago may no longer be relevant, particularly in the cases of C increments and fluxes.

Remote sensing biomass estimates include standing dead wood [@duncanson_aboveground_2021].
