\introduction[Introduction]

\emph{(Importance of forests for climate change mitigation)}

\emph{(Need for good data in international carbon accounting)}

\emph{(Introduce EFDb \& forc)}

Example citation \citep{anderson-teixeira_forc_2018}

Here, we: (1) clarify C cycle terminology (2) describe mapping of ForC
to IPCC's EFDB, (3) describe updates to ForC (ForC v4.0) (4) summarize
the data in ForC that's relevant to EFDB, identifying gaps (5) provide
recommendations for improving data collection, analysis, database, and
accounting

\section{Defining carbon stocks and incremenets}

For quantifying forest role in global C cycle, we ultimately care about:
(1) C stocks --stores of C that would be released to the atmosphere upon
and use change (2) C increments -- changes in those C stocks.

\subsection{Carbon stocks}

Forest ecosystem C stocks may be parsed into pools in various ways. IPCC
parses into biomass (aboveground and belowground), dead organic matter
(dead wood and litter), and soil organic matter (Table 1). Quantifying
these requires a one-time measurement.

\newpage

\textbf{Table 1: variables with definitions and measurement methods.}
Definitions from IPCC Table 1.1. (See Table 1.1 in IPCC guidance).
(\emph{Currently adding this as a figure (generated from original draft)
because kableExtra doesn't seem to work in this template, and I can't
quickly get the template format to work. Table that we want here is
``figures\_tables/C\_pools.csv''})

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=12cm]{figures_tables/C_pools_fig} \caption{Table 1}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-1}
\end{figure}

\begin{table*}[t]
\caption{This is a start at table 1 using the template format. }
\begin{tabular}{l c c c r}
\tophline

pool & subpool & definition & major sources of estimate variation & IPCC guidance \\
\middlehline
biomass & aboveground & all biomass of living vegetation, both woody and herbaceous, above the soil & allometry, min dbh & acceptable to exclude understory  \\

\bottomhline
\end{tabular}
\belowtable{I don't know how to adjust so that it doesn't run off the page.}
\end{table*}

\subsection{Carbon increments}

C increments are defined as the change over time, in annual increments,
in each C pool. These may be estimated as the difference between C
stocks at two time points, or as the difference between inputs and
outputs to the pool (i.e., fluxes). Quantifying these requires at least
two measurements.

Fluxes are the inputs and outputs to each pool.

\appendix
\section{Figures and tables in appendices}

Regarding figures and tables in appendices, the following two options
are possible depending on your general handling of figures and tables in
the manuscript environment:

\subsection{Option 1}

If you sorted all figures and tables into the sections of the text,
please also sort the appendix figures and appendix tables into the
respective appendix sections. They will be correctly named
automatically.

\subsection{Option 2}

If you put all figures after the reference list, please insert appendix
tables and figures after the normal tables and figures.

To rename them correctly to A1, A2, etc., please add the following
commands in front of them: \texttt{\textbackslash{}appendixfigures}
needs to be added in front of appendix figures
\texttt{\textbackslash{}appendixtables} needs to be added in front of
appendix tables

Please add \texttt{\textbackslash{}clearpage} between each table and/or
figure. Further guidelines on figures and tables can be found below.
