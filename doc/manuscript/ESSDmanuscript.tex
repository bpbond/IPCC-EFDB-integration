\introduction[Introduction]

\textbf{(Forest are critical for climate change mitigation)}

\textbf{(Need for good data in international carbon accounting)}

\textbf{(Introduce EFDB \& ForC)}

Here, we: (1) clarify definitions of relevant carbon stocks and
increments (2) describe mapping of ForC to IPCC's EFDB, (3) describe
updates to ForC (ForC v4.0), (4) summarize the data in ForC that's
relevant to EFDB, identifying gaps, and (5) provide recommendations for
improving data collection, analysis, database, and accounting.

\section{Defining carbon stocks and incremenets}

For quantifying forest role in global C cycle, we ultimately care about:
(1) C stocks --stores of C that would be released to the atmosphere upon
and use change (2) C increments -- changes in those C stocks.

\subsection{Carbon stocks}

Forest ecosystem C stocks may be parsed into pools in various ways. IPCC
parses into biomass (aboveground and belowground), dead organic matter
(dead wood and litter), and soil organic matter (Table 1). Quantifying
these requires a one-time measurement.

\newpage

\textbf{Table 1: variables with definitions and measurement methods.}
Definitions from IPCC Table 1.1. (See Table 1.1 in IPCC guidance).
(\emph{Currently adding this as a figure (generated from original draft)
because kableExtra doesn't seem to work in this template, and I can't
quickly get the template format to work. Table that we want here is
``figures\_tables/C\_pools.csv''})

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=12cm]{figures_tables/C_pools_fig} \caption{Table 1}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-1}
\end{figure}

\begin{table*}[t]
\caption{This is a start at table 1 using the template format. }
\begin{tabular}{l c c c r}
\tophline

pool & subpool & definition & major sources of estimate variation & IPCC guidance \\
\middlehline
biomass & aboveground & all biomass of living vegetation, both woody and herbaceous, above the soil & allometry, min dbh & acceptable to exclude understory  \\

\bottomhline
\end{tabular}
\belowtable{I don't know how to adjust so that it doesn't run off the page.}
\end{table*}

\subsection{Carbon increments}

C increments are defined as the change over time, in annual increments,
in each C pool. These may be estimated as the difference between C
stocks at two time points, or as the difference between inputs and
outputs to the pool (i.e., fluxes). Quantifying these requires at least
two measurements.

Fluxes are the inputs and outputs to each pool.

\textbf{Figure: schematic illustrating fluxes in and out of each pool}

\section{Mapping ForC to EFDB}

\subsection{Carbon cycle variables}

\textbf{Table: variable mapping and equations-- give equations to
calculate IPCC variables from C cycle variables}

Define relationship among NEE, NEP, and delta.C., especially noting role
of harvest.

\subsection{Land use categories}

\section{Updates to ForC (ForC v4.0)}

To support export of data to EFDB, and to improve the overall quality of
the ForC database, we implemented some modest restructuring, resolved
duplicate records, and conducted quality control. This section describes
changes relative to ForC v2.0 \citep{anderson-teixeira_forc_2018}.

\subsection{ForC restructuring}

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=12cm]{figures_tables/ForC_updates_placeholder_fig} \caption{Table of changes to ForC fields (placeholder) }\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-2}
\end{figure}

\emph{(The above is a placeholder for the table located at
https://github.com/forc-db/ForC/blob/master/database\_management\_records/record\_of\_changes.csv,
which we'll need to format.)}

\subsection{Quality control measures}

Prior to releasing ForC v4.0, we executed several quality control
measures. First, to improve information on geographic coordinates, we
flagged and reviewed records with suspected low precision \emph{(Issue
\#29){[}https://github.com/forc-db/ForC/issues/229{]}}. Second, to
identify erroneous climate data\ldots{} \emph{(Issue
\#212){[}https://github.com/forc-db/ForC/issues/212{]}}.

\subsection{Resolving duplicates}

\section{Results}

\textbf{figure: map of relevant ForC data with underlying FAO ecozones}

\textbf{(summarize the data in ForC that's relevant to EFDB, identifying
gaps)}

dead wood and litter comparisons will be particularly interesting, as
IPCC values are based on just a handful of references for each climate
zone (table 2.2 in 2019 guidelines)

\section{Recommendations}

\subsection{Data collection and analysis needs}

\textbf{(Paragraph highlighting important gaps in variables / regions)}

Several variables of value to IPCC, including standing dead wood, woody
mortality, delta.agb, are not calculated and presented as frequently as
are AGB and ANPP\_woody, even though they can readily be derived from
the same census data. We recommend that researchers calculate and report
these, as specified below. Furthermore, there is an opportunity to fill
data gaps by calculating these from existing census data. For example,
the core census protocol of the Forest Global Earth Observatory
{[}ForestGEO; REFS{]} collects the data required to calculate standing
dead wood, woody mortality, and delta.agb, but these have not been
calculated and reported for all sites for which the appropriate number
of censuses are available (n=1 for standing dead wood, n=2 for woody
mortality and delta.agb) {[}but see REFS{]}.

A universal challenge in estimating biomass (living or dead) from forest
census data is applying appropriate allometries to convert DBH
measurements to biomass. \emph{(Camille/Helene can write this paragraph
easily.)}

\subsection{Data reporting needs}

We recommend that, unless they have some specific reason to do
otherwise, researchers calculate and report the values according to IPCC
standards:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  adopt common standards for variables like min diameter of deadwood,
  select soil sampling increments to include a cutoff at 30.
\item
  report 95\% CIs, SE, or STD and n
\item
  report C variables in article text, table, or SI table. EFDB cannot
  accept data digitized from figures
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Contributing data to ForC and/or EFDB directly will ensure its
broader impact.} The latter is more efficient for getting data to EFDB,
but does not get the data into ForC, where it can be more broadly
useful--for example, being used for basic science
\citep[e.g.,][]{banburymorgan_global_2021, anderson-teixeira_carbon_2021}
or model benchmarking \citep{fer_ecosystem_2021}.

\subsection{Database needs}

There are plenty of relevant, published data that are not included in
ForC. Systematic review of the literature could vastly improve data
coverage. \emph{(There are some efforts underway, including a few that
Susan can specify.)}

\subsection{IPCC}

An important challenge is that forests are changing rapidly, and data
collected a decaade ago may no longer be relevant, particularly in the
cases of C increments and fluxes.

Remote sensing biomass estimates include standing dead wood
\citep{duncanson_aboveground_2021}.
