The stand's density, survival and growth parameters (DBH, total height, crown diameter and number of branches) varied significantly with age and site. The number of stems was highest (789trees/ha) in a 1-year-old plantation at site 3 (Kusumi) and lowest (724trees/ha) in a 6-year-old stand at site 2 (Anandgoan). Allometric equations for stem wood, branches, leaves and roots to tree diameter at breast height were developed to estimate above ground and below ground tree biomass. The total biomass ranged from 3.9Mgha-1 in 1-year-old to 53.7Mgha-1 in 6-year-old stand. The stem wood contributed from 55.3% (site 3) to 56.3% (site 1), branch wood from 18.3% (site 2) to 19.8% (site 3), roots from 17.9% (site 3) to 18.5% (site 2) and foliage from 6.6% (site 2) to 7.0% (site 3) of the total biomass. The growth and biomass production were poor from establishment to 3 years age and it increased by 1.5-2 times as the plantation aged from 4-6 years. Nutrient accumulation in tree biomass increased with stand age, following the pattern of biomass accumulation. The total nitrogen accumulation in 6-year-old stands at three sites ranged from 212.9 to 279.5kgha-1 with a mean annual storage of 238.4kgha-1 and total K ranged from 170.8 to 220.5kgha-1 with a mean annual storage of 189.9kgha-1. Phosphorous storage was lowest which ranged from 15.0 to 19.6kgha-1 with a mean storage of 16.8kgha-1. The organic matter and nutrients in the soils improved significantly after 6 years of planting.

The number of stems was highest (789trees/ha) in a 1-year-old plantation at site 3 (Kusumi) and lowest (724trees/ha) in a 6-year-old stand at site 2 (Anandgoan). Allometric equations for stem wood, branches, leaves and roots to tree diameter at breast height were developed to estimate above ground and below ground tree biomass.

The growth and biomass production were poor from establishment to 3 years age and it increased by 1.5-2 times as the plantation aged from 4-6 years.
