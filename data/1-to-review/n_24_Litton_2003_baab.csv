Belowground biomass allocation increased with tree density, but the increase was largely determined by inherent differences associated with tree size, not competition. Stand biomass in trees ranged from 46 to 5529 kgÂ·ha<U+0096>1 belowground, from 176 to 9400 kgÂ·ha<U+0096>1 aboveground, and from 222 to 13 685 kgÂ·ha<U+0096>1 for total biomass. For individual trees, the ratio of belowground to total biomass declined with tree size from 0.44 at a basal diameter of 0.5 cm to 0.11 at a basal diameter of 8 cm. This shift in individual tree allocation caused the proportion of total stand biomass in belowground tissues to increase from 19% in low-density stands with larger trees to 31% in high-density stands with small trees.","NA","NA","","","","","Other [e.g. Compiled] (3)","","","","","","confidence notes: 95%CI is NA because only 1 plot was measured; biomass allometry source: Litton, C.
