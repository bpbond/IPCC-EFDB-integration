Mean annual litterfall was very sensitive to typhoon frequency and intensity, ranging from 3 to 11 MgÂ·ha<U+0096>1Â·year<U+0096>1. Litterfall was significantly higher in years with strong typhoons than in years without typhoons, and the number of strong typhoons explained 82% of interannual variation in litterfall. Nutrient-use efficiency (dry mass/nutrients in litterfall) was high for N, but low for P compared with other tropical forests. This result supports the idea that the study forest is P limited but not N limited. Nutrient loss via litterfall represents a large percentage of aboveground biomass, especially during years with strong typhoons (e.g., 19%<U+0096>41%, 15%<U+0096>40%, 5%<U+0096>12%, for N, P, and K, respectively). Forests that experience infrequent wind disturbance (e.g., temperate or boreal forests) can gradually regain any lost nutrients prior to the next disturbance; this is different from the situation observed in the Fushan Experimental Forest. At Fu-shan the pattern of not responding to typhoons with a flush of new growth appears to be an adaptation to the frequency with which there are multiple typhoons affecting the forest in a single year. Nutrient loss in litterfall caused by frequent typhoon disturbances appears to limit tree growth and contributes to the very low canopy height of the Fushan Experimental Forest.",217.6,228.5,"","","","","Other [e.g. Compiled] (3)","","","","","","Data imported from the Global Forest Carbon database (ForC; https://forc-db.github.io/) : Anderson-Teixeira, K.
