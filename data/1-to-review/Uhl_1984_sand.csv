The hill forests are never flooded and have soils consisting of a sandy horizon (from a few centimetres to 2 m in depth) over- lying a thick horizon composed of kaolinite clay and lateritic concretions. These soils are classified as Oxisols (United States 7th approximation) or Ferralsols (FAO classification). Both horizons are acid and highly weathered, and have low cation exchange capacity and high iron and aluminum content (Jordan 1982). Above the mineral soil is a mat of humus and roots which plays an important role in nutrient cycling (Jordan and Herrera 1981).","country: Venezuela; state/province/region: Amazonas; nearest city: San Carlos de Rio Negro; geographic coordinates: 1.933333, -67.05; elevation: 119 m; biogeographic zone: South America; Koeppen climate zone: Af; FAO ecological zone: Tropical rainforest; mean annual temperature: 26.88 degrees C; annual precipitation: 3500 mm yr-1","ForC site: Rio Negro age sequence (ID#: 1531); ForC plot: Forest recovery following cutting and burning (ID#: 2009); ForC measurement ID: 48959; Date of Measurement: 1981.8-1980.8; disturbance type: Burned; disturbance year: 1976.915301; regrowth type: Initiation of post-disturbance cohort (natural); regrowth year: 1976.915301; variable description: Annual branch turnover, typically determined by collecting branch fall throughout the year.; ",122,"tonnes dm/ha/year (273)","","","Equation 2.18","","Peer-reviewed journal","Ueyama, M., Harazono, Y., Ohtaki, E., & Miyata, A.
