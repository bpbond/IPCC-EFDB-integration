One quarter century later, the larger snags are beginning to fall, transitioning to deadwood (down woody debris) where they may influence fire behavior, regeneration, and habitat structure. We tracked all fallen trees ³_1_cm in diameter at breast height (1.37-m high) and mapped all pieces of deadwood ³_10-cm diameter and_³_1_m in length within 13.64_ha of a high-elevation mixed-species forest in the PiceaÐAbies zone annually for 5_years from 2015 through 2019. We examined the relative contribution of Picea engelmannii to snag and deadwood pools relative to other species and the relative contributions of large-diameter trees (³_33.2_cm at this subalpine site). We compared spatially explicit mapping of deadwood to traditional measures of surface fuels and introduce a new method for approximating vertical distribution of deadwood. In this mixed-species forest, there was relatively high density and basal area of live Picea engelmannii 20_years after the beetle outbreak (36 trees ha_1 and 1.94_m2_ha_1_³_10-cm diameter) contrasting with the near total mortality of mature Picea in forests nearby. Wood from tree boles ³_10-cm diameter on the ground had biomass of 42_Mg_ha_1, 7_Mg_ha_1 of Picea engelmannii, and 35_Mg_ha_1 of other species. Total live aboveground biomass was 119_Mg_ha_1, while snag biomass was 36_Mg_ha_1. Mean total fuel loading measured with planar transects was 63_Mg_ha_1 but varied more than three orders of magnitude (0.1 to 257_Mg_ha_1). Planar transects recorded 32_Mg_ha_1 of wood ³_7.62-cm diameter compared to the 42_Mg_ha_1 of wood ³_10-cm diameter recorded by explicit mapping. Multiple pieces of deadwood were often stacked, forming a vertical structure likely to contribute to active fire behavior. Bark beetle mortality in the 1990s has made Picea an important local constituent of deadwood at 20-m scales, but other species dominate total deadwood due to slow decomposition rates and the multi-centennial intervals between fires. Explicit measurements of deadwood and surface fuels improve ecological insights into biomass heterogeneity and potential fire behavior.","Unknown","Unknown","","","","","Other [e.g. Compiled] (3)","","","","","","Data location within source: text (Results); Data imported from the Global Forest Carbon database (ForC; https://forc-db.github.io/) : Anderson-Teixeira, K.
