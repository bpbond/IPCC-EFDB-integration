Minimizing the error in forest biomass estimates is necessary in order to reduce the uncertainty in future Amazon carbon budgets. We examined forest survey data for trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) greater than 35Â cm from four plots with a total area of 392Â ha in the Tapajos National Forest near Santarem, Para, Brazil (3Â°04'S, 54Â°95'W). The average frequency of trees greater than 35Â cm DBH was approximately 55Â ha-1. Based on tree diameters, allometric relations, and published relations for biomass in other compartments besides trees of DBH>35cm, we estimated a total biomass density of 372Â MgÂ ha-1.
