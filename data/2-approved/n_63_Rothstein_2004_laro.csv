We quantified the amount of C stored in aboveground plant biomass, standing dead timber, downed dead wood, surface organic soil, and mineral soil in 11 jack pine stands that had burned between 1 and 72 years previously. Total ecosystem C ranged from a low of 59 Mg CÂ·ha<U+0096>1 in the 4-year-old stand to 110 Mg CÂ·ha<U+0096>1 in the 72-year-old stand. Changes in total ecosystem C across the chronosequence conformed to theoretical predictions, in which C stocks declined initially as decomposition of dead wood and forest-floor C exceeded production by regenerating vegetation, and then increased asymptotically with the development of a new stand of jack pine.

We quantified the amount of C stored in aboveground plant biomass, standing dead timber, downed dead wood, surface organic soil, and mineral soil in 11 jack pine stands that had burned between 1 and 72 years previously. Total ecosystem C ranged from a low of 59 Mg CÂ·ha<U+0096>1 in the 4-year-old stand to 110 Mg CÂ·ha<U+0096>1 in the 72-year-old stand. Changes in total ecosystem C across the chronosequence conformed to theoretical predictions, in which C stocks declined initially as decomposition of dead wood and forest-floor C exceeded production by regenerating vegetation, and then increased asymptotically with the development of a new stand of jack pine.
