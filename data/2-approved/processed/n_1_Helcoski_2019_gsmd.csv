For the first time, we combined long-term annual growth and forest census data of a diverse temperate broadleaf deciduous forest, seeking to resolve whether ANPPstem is primarily moisture- or energy-limited and whether climate sensi- tivity has changed in recent decades characterised by more mesic conditions and elevated CO2. We analysed tree-ring chronologies across 109 yr of monthly climatic variation (1901Ð 2009) for 14 species representing 97% of ANPPstem in a 25.6 ha plot in northern Virginia, USA. Radial growth of most species and ecosystem-level ANPPstem responded positively to cool, moist growing season conditions, but the same conditions in the previous MayÐJuly were associated with reduced growth. In recent decades (1980Ð2009), responses were more vari- able and, on average, weaker. Our results indicated that woody productivity is primarily limited by current growing season moisture, as opposed to temperature or sunlight, but additional complexity in climate sensitiv- ity may reflect the use of stored carbohydrate reserves. Overall, while such forests currently display limited moisture sensitivity, their woody productivity is likely to decline under pro- jected hotter and potentially drier growing season conditions.","NA","NA","","","","","Other [e.g. Compiled] (3)","","","","","","confidence notes: 95%CI is NA because only 1 plot was measured; biomass allometry source: Gonzalez-Akre, E., Meakem, V., Eng, C., Tepley, A.
