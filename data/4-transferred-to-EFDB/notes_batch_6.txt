n_6_Ishihara_2016_anmf was withdrawn because we realized the values had been calculated (from records in the Supplementary Information)

n_28_Manlay_2002_cnap was edited to correct an erroneous land classification code

n_32_Broadbent_2014 replaces n_28_Broadbent_2014, having added 4 records that were previously missing

n_1_Lutz_2018_giol adds a previously-missed record from this study (note that there are now several files for this study, including one with the same name)

n_6_Mall_1991_sobl is for mangroves. I'm not sure if they should be classified as forests, wetlands, or both. We currently have the classified as forest; please let us know if it should be otherwise

n_30_Wirth_1999_abas adds to n_6_Wirth_1999_abas
